# Build Cool Shit, Reduce World Suck

I have a deeply rooted interest in developing systems that augment human capabilities, examples include aircraft fly-by-wire systems, reinforcement learning for next-best-move prediction, and modifying vim to create the world's best code editor for myself.
There is something truly uncanny about having a machine feel like an extension of self that drives my interest in everything I do. 
My main hobbies include flying FPV drones and playing various musical instruments - machines augmenting my ability to perceive and influence the world.
